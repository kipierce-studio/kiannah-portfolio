                    <h2>Hello! 👋</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        I'm a innovate specialist with a passion for educational equity and creativity. 
                        I believe in quality education for all students, no matter their background.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey began when I worked for Breakthrough Collaborative and witnessed the inequities of our education system first hand. 
                        Growing up, I was no stranger to the Title 1 life. I come from a broken home, one in which we did not have much money. My brothers and I were on free lunch all the way through high school graduation. 
                        The thing that saved us was the village we had surrounding us. When I worked as a Teacher then Dean of Students at Breakthrough Collaborative, I realized just how lucky I was for my village. 
                        Since then, I've been focused on developing skills in educational technology, policy analysis, and professional communication, and working on projects that will improve the quality of education for all students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm a student in UNC Chapel Hill's Masters of Educational Innovation, Technology, and Entreprenurship program, specializing in innovating learning. 
                        I'm particularly interested in low-technology solutions to educational inequities and love 
                        collaborating with others who share similar passions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not studying, you can find me all over Chapel Hill. Whether I am at softball practice, or trying out a new coffee shop with a friend, I have become a true Tar Heel. 
                        After moving across the country to pursue a collegiate athletics and a high quality education, I would say I'm always eager to learn new things and take on exciting challenges.
